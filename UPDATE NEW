🌌 Way Engine: The New Beginning

Sorry for the silence lately! I’ve been deep in development. After two months of work, I realized the initial architecture was holding the engine back.

I’ve made the tough but necessary call to start from scratch. I'm rebuilding the Way Engine with a clean, efficient architecture from the ground up.

🚀 The first Test Version is coming December 31st! > Please note: It will be an early "damp" build, focused on testing the new core systems.

Thank you for staying tuned. The best is yet to come!
