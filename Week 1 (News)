🚀 Way Engine DevLog | Week 1: Building the Foundation
Hello everyone! 👋 I’m excited to share the first weekly update of my custom game engine project — Way Engine. This week was all about moving away from "spaghetti code" toward a professional architecture.

🏗️ Architecture Milestone
We have successfully transitioned from a monolithic structure to a clean, Component-Based Architecture (CBA). This is a huge step for the engine's future scalability!

🛠️ Key Technical Updates:
Smart Entity System: Implemented a centralized Entity class with dynamic ID generation and automatic scene registration via Dictionaries. 🆔

Modular Mesh Component: Encapsulated VAO, VBO, and Shader logic. This decouples raw data from the main loop, making the engine much cleaner. 📦

Transform & Color: Created specialized structures to manage spatial data and aesthetic properties independently. 🎨

Optimized Rendering Pipeline: Developed an automated render loop that iterates through entities, significantly reducing complexity in the core Game class. ⚡

Data Decoupling: Vertex definitions are now handled by a dedicated Type system, allowing for easy expansion. 📂

🤫 Behind the Scenes
There is also some "secret magic" happening under the hood right now... I’m not ready to reveal it just yet, but stay tuned! I'll be sharing more soon. ✨

📅 Roadmap
My goal is to have a clean, high-performance engine core
