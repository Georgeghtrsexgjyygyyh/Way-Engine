# Way Engine

**Way Engine** is a cross-platform 2D (and future 3D) game engine focused on **simplicity**, **flexibility**, and **accessibility** for indie developers of all skill levels.

🎮 It offers **three powerful ways** to create games:

1. 💻 Programming in **C#**, **Python**, or **C++**
2. 🎨 Visual scripting system *(like Blueprints or Scratch)*
3. 🤖 Built-in AI – **GameGPT**, which can generate mini-games (e.g. Dino Run, Flappy Bird) in the free version, and more complex ones in the Pro version

> _Way Engine aims to reshape the future of indie game development._
